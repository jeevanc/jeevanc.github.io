		<p>Hola! everyone. I am currently a Computer Science PhD Students at The University of Memphis. I am working under <a href="http://www.cs.memphis.edu/~vrus/"> Dr. Vasile Rus </a> in Langauge and Information Processing Lab. My research interest  primarily focuses on the field of <b>Natural Language Processing</b>, <b>Deep Learning</b>,<b> Information Retreival</b>, <b>Semantic Similarity</b> and <b>Intelligent Tutoring System.</b></p>

		<p>I completed my under graduate degree from Tribhuvan University in 2017. During my under graduate I did my internship in Kathmandu Living Labs which is a civic tech company that focuses on mobile technology and mapping. I was also involved in different open source communities like FOSS Nepal, Mozilla Nepal whose sole purpose is to aware people about open source software and its importance and create a community of open source users.</p>

		<p>Currently I am working on an intelligent tutoring system which is meant to ease students' introduction to programming during their early encounters with CS concepts and tasks. I am also part of another research group that is working on to improve the effectiveness of the learning ecosystem for the benefit of its hundreds of thousands of students, prepare teachers for the future learning ecosystem, and contribute to accelerating discovery and transforming the education ecosystem through the use of big data and cloud computing. Aside from that I have been doing other pet projects that will help me uplift my research.</p>
